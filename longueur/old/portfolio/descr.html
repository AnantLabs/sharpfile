This is a list of the websites that I have worked on along with a description of what I have performed and the compensation.<br>
Note: Some of these are not listed on my online portfolio page because I do not think they are designed particularly well, however, they were school projects or are sites which I only updated and maintained the contents.  I have marked these websites with an asterisk.<br><br>

Active Learning Conference<br>
<a href="http://www.goucher.edu/thormann/alconference/" target="_blank">http://www.goucher.edu/thormann/alconference/</a><br>
I designed and maintained the site for the Active Learning Conference at Goucher College.  I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a digital camera to provide information regarding the purpose of the conference, biographies of the speakers and general information on the program.<br>

Essayslink.com<br>
<a href="http://www.essayslink.com/" target="_blank">http://www.essayslink.com/</a><br>
I did not design the original site, although I updated it and maintain the site.  I converted it from a static HTML website to a dynamic PHP website.  The modifications included dynamically reading from a directory for a listing of files and dynamically counting the number of files in a directory, among other things.<br>
Compensation based on the number of users who register<br><br>

I did not design the original site, however I made specific HTML improvements throughout the summer.  I had originally planned to make the site more dynamic (e.g. storing pictures in a database and retrieving pictures by PHP), but there were time restrictions. A password is required to view the content.<br>

Exitonly.org<br>
<a href="http://www.exitonly.org/" target="_blank">http://www.exitonly.org/</a><br>
My personal site where I experiment with HTML, DHTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and any other emerging technologies deemed interesting.  It has not been updated recently because of increasing schoolwork and work commitments.  There are numerous subsections under this website which are shown in the online portfolio.  They all use the same basic technology.  I designed and maintain the site.<br>

Four-D Project Page*<br>
<a href="http://phoenix.goucher.edu/~fourd/" target="_blank">http://phoenix.goucher.edu/~fourd/</a><br>
This was a school project that I did not originally design although I helped with some of the HTML coding (~15%).  I did the bulk (~95%) of the PHP coding that drove the actual site.  It links into a PostgreSQL database for the usernames and passwords and displays different content dependent on whether the user is a student, teacher, or administrator.  For students, the site shows a quiz.  For teachers, the site displays the scores for their respective students. The database holds the scores for all quizzes taken by the students. For administrators, the site allows them to add, modify or create users and/or questions for the quiz.  For more detailed information, the proposal is here: http://phoenix.goucher.edu/~fourd/papers/proposal.html.  This site requires a password to login.<br>

<a href="http://www.goucher.edu/library/av/winslow/" target="_blank">http://www.goucher.edu/library/av/winslow/</a><br>
I did not design this site, however, I updated and maintained its contents. The site uses HTML and JavaScript to display political buttons collected by Clinton Winslow, a faculty member for over 50 years at Goucher College.<br>

<a href="http://www.letreb.com/" target="_blank">http://www.letreb.com/</a><br>
I did not design this site, however, I update and maintained its contents while instructing Dr. Klee how to use FrontPage to expand his personal site.  The site uses HTML to display articles, stories, anecdotes and a personal genealogy of the Klee family.<br>
