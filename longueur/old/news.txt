08.22.03: It has been a long time coming. A major cleanup soon to fix the broken links and whatnot.<br><br>

01.06.03: As has been promised has (somewhat) occured -- a minor cleanup and addition of some extra stuff.<br><br>

11.30.02: It has been a long time since I updated this site... school has been crazy and I have been working a lot as well. Things <i>should</i> get updated over winter break.<br><br>

09.02.02: Just added a lot to my online journal. Basically the last 2-3 months. Email me if you want the address. I will get around to updating the rest of this site eventually.<br><br>

03.22.02: Added some stuff to <i>stimuli</i>, but I do not really have time to do a lot of work on any of the site. School is kind of more important than my hobbies, unfortunately.<br><br> 

12.26.01: Converted all sections to php when necessary, also cleaned up some random stuff. Still looking for a flat-file management system. Trying to update more than once every few weeks, but don't hold your breath.<br><br>

12.13.01: Now experimenting with php for updating the entire website. Anyone know of a very lightweight flat-file news system? All I want is the ability to add, edit, and remove entries in a flat-file database. All news systems either want to use a mySQL database or, if they are flat-file, they are entirely too complex for what I am looking for. <a href="mailto:paradox@exitonly.org" onmouseover="window.status='email.'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">Email</a> if you can help.<br><br>

11.17.01: Stopped using Blogger because it wouldn't update my settings or template. Updated stimuli as well.<br><br>

11.06.01: Updated <a href="ambient/index.html" onmouseover="window.status='ambient.'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">ambient, inc.</a> and fixed <a href="minimalism/index.shtml" onmouseover="window.status='minimalism.'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">minimalism</a> and <a href="naive/v5/index.html" onmouseover="window.status='naive.'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true">naive</a>.<br><br>

10.27.01: Updated a bunch of stuff and added a navbar along the bottom. If you want it to disappear just click on <i>break out of frames</i>.<br><br>

10.04.01: After being offline for a while I brought the site back. Hopefully, I will have more time now and I will update once and awhile.<br><br>
