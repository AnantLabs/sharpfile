BUGS
- KeyCodes in the settings prevents other settings from loading
- Filesystem events don't correctly update status bar
- Network drive (z:) not sorted correctly
- Multiple filewatcher events fire on one file operation 
	-catch them all and just update once in a stack
- Filter textbox too small to fit
- Flickering textboxes when resizing
- inconsistent behavior for drag/drop copy/move behavior
- splitcontainer context menu shows up after an action is selected in a listview context menu
- long-running threads to get directories/files invoked from the drive drop down aren't canceled
	when starting a new operation

TODO
- Add the timer to the progress disk class with the ability to start/stop it
- Specify keycodes for actions
	- name/value as attributes instead of elements
	- IAction?
- SharpFile.Interface.dll
- ability to use keyboard to tab between elements
	- panels, tabs, select a drive, etc.
- special folders in drive drop down
	- my documents, control panel?, desktop
- Specify defaults for settings as an attribute on the property
- Log4net support to log detailed debug logs
- Refresh of drive listing when new drives are entered (usb keys and the like)
- Refresh button
- Sorting of listview by column
- Drag-and-drop support for links (both ways)
- thumbnail files when possible (images?)
- show an icon of the file being dragged around
- Make sure that all code in UI (child) is neccessary and couldn't be moved to infrastructure/IO
- Prevent drag-and-drop operation if it is completed in less than some arbitrary time limit (200 ms?)
- Validate rename before-hand and throw up tooltip or something (beforeedit event)
- Information/Property slideable "pane" list like vista's file manager
- Extra tab functionality: middle-click to close tabs, mouse wheel, ctrl-tab
- Full-row select
- test to make sure that filesystemwatcher events still fire even when updating the UI
- copy/move should show progress (write bytes, as opposed to File.Copy()?) 
	- should it use built-in copy/move functionality?
	- ability to queue items to copy/move
- Type to find (like servant salamander)
- preview panel for some filetypes (QuickLook ?)
- Configuration (view, columns, icon size, extensions to grab icons for)
- Specifying columns to show in listview (should be done in the childresource?)
- command line - orthodox specifications
- FTP drive functionality
- SCP drive functionality
- NFS drive functionality
- Double-clicking compressed file shows files contained within

VISTA BUGS
	- No icon overlays
	- Ugly child-tab buttons (I want them flat)
	- ProgressDisk in wrong position -- needs to be attached to status bar somehow
