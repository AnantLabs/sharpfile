BUGS
- KeyCodes in the settings prevents other settings from loading
- Filesystem events don't correctly update status bar
- Filter textbox too small to fit
- Flickering textboxes when resizing
- network drives don't get filesystemwatcher events
- splitcontainer context menu shows up after an action is selected in a listview context menu
- long-running threads to get directories/files invoked from the drive drop down aren't canceled
	when starting a new operation
- flicker in drive dropdown when new drive is inserted
	- instead of clearing the drive dropdown and adding newly added drives, just insert/remove the drive being changed

TODO
- Specifying columns to show in listview
	- childresource specifies what properties are available
	- xml settings to specify actual columns to show from the available columns
- split settings into more logical sections -- dualview settings would have an element just for their information, etc
- instead of intelligently trying to determine if a remote computer should have a filesystem event set up for it,
	maybe all network drives should have a manual filesystem watcher (detailed below)
- wrap all of the filesystemwatchers in my custom filesystemwatcher
	- queue events so that only one event gets fired for filesystem changes
	- for systems that don't support filesystem events (i.e. z:\, network drive), 
		set up a manual refresh every 500 ms or so (configurable)
- Add the timer to the progress disk class with the ability to start/stop it
- Specify keycodes for actions
	- name/value as attributes instead of elements
	- IAction?
- ability to use keyboard to tab between elements
	- panels, tabs, select a drive, etc.
- special folders in drive drop down
	- my documents, control panel?, desktop
- Specify defaults for settings as an attribute on the property
- Log4net support to log detailed debug logs
- Refresh button (or key)
- Drag-and-drop support for links
- thumbnail files when possible (images?)
- show an icon of the file being dragged around
- Prevent drag-and-drop operation if it is completed in less than some arbitrary time limit (200 ms?)
- Validate rename before-hand and throw up tooltip or something (beforeedit event)
- Information/Property slideable "pane" list like vista's file manager
- tab functionality
	- middle-click to close tabs
	- mouse wheel
	- ctrl-tab
- Full-row select
- test to make sure that filesystemwatcher events still fire even when updating the UI
- copy/move should show progress (write bytes, as opposed to File.Copy()?) 
	- should it use built-in copy/move functionality?
	- ability to queue items to copy/move
- Type to find (like servant salamander)
- preview panel for some filetypes (QuickLook ?)
- settings
	- view
	- icon size
	- extensions to grab icons for
- command line - orthodox specifications
- FTP drive functionality
- SCP drive functionality
- NFS drive functionality
- Double-clicking compressed file shows files contained within

VISTA BUGS
	- No icon overlays
	- Ugly child-tab buttons (I want them flat)
	- ProgressDisk in wrong position -- needs to be attached to status bar somehow
