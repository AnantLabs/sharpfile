BUGS
- "System Volume Information folder" never returns any information
- Filesystem events don't correctly update status bar
- Network drive (z:) not sorted correctly
- Multiple filewatcher events fire on one file operation -- catch them all and just update once?
- Filter textbox too small to fit
- Flickering textboxes when resizing

TODO
- Specify defaults for settings as an attribute on the property
- No hardcoded parent/child form stuff
- Update parent form with path info	(done for Dual, needs to be done for others)
- Log4net support to log detailed debug logs
- Save the position of the seperator for the dual file view
- Show title of the currently selected directory in the parent
- Add file menu to base so that dual has access to it as well; some things will be only in the mdi parent, though
- Refresh of drive listing when new drives are entered
- Refresh button
- Sorting of listview by column
- Able to cancel long-running operations (esc?)
- Drag-and-drop support for links (both ways)
- thumbnail files when possible (images?)
- show an icon of the file being dragged around
- Clean up menus and icons at top (some don't apply)
- Make sure that all code in UI (child) is neccessary and couldn't be moved to infrastructure/IO
- Prevent drag-and-drop operation if it is completed in less than some arbitrary time limit (200 ms?)
- Validate rename before-hand and throw up tooltip or something
- Information/Property slideable "pane" list like vista's file manager
- middle-click to close tabs, mouse wheel, ctrl-tab functionality
- Hot-tracking listview
- Full-row select
- test to make sure that filesystemwatcher events still fire even when updating the UI
- copy/move should show progress (write bytes, as opposed to File.Copy()?) -- should it use built-in copy/move functionality?
- Type to find (like servant salamander)
- preview panel for some filetypes (QuickLook ?)
- Configuration (view, columns, icon size, extensions to grab icons for)
- Specifying columns to show in listview (should be done in the childresource?)

VISTA BUGS
	No icon overlays
	Ugly child-tab buttons (I want them flat)
	ProgressDisk in wrong position -- needs to be attached to status bar somehow
