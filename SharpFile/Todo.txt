BUGS
- KeyCodes in the settings prevents other settings from loading
- "System Volume Information folder" never returns any information
	- recursive file/directory issue?
- Filesystem events don't correctly update status bar
- Network drive (z:) not sorted correctly
- Multiple filewatcher events fire on one file operation 
	-catch them all and just update once in a stack
- Filter textbox too small to fit
- Flickering textboxes when resizing
- inconsistent behavior for drag/drop copy/move behavior
- second context menu sometimes after an action is selected in the first context menu
- if there is more than one long running operation, the progress disk stops when the first is finished

TODO
- Specify keycodes for actions
	- name/value as attributes instead of elements
	- IAction?
- SharpFile.Interface.dll
- right-click context menu for default percentages for dual view
- ability to collapse either panel or the other
- swap panels with key
- ability to use keyboard to tab between elements
	- panels, tabs, select a drive, etc.
- special folders in drive drop down
	- my documents, control panel?, desktop
- Specify defaults for settings as an attribute on the property
- No hardcoded parent/child form stuff
- Log4net support to log detailed debug logs
- Refresh of drive listing when new drives are entered (usb keys and the like)
- Refresh button
- Sorting of listview by column
- Able to cancel long-running operations (esc?)
- Drag-and-drop support for links (both ways)
- thumbnail files when possible (images?)
- show an icon of the file being dragged around
- Make sure that all code in UI (child) is neccessary and couldn't be moved to infrastructure/IO
- Prevent drag-and-drop operation if it is completed in less than some arbitrary time limit (200 ms?)
- Validate rename before-hand and throw up tooltip or something
- Information/Property slideable "pane" list like vista's file manager
- Extra tab functionality: middle-click to close tabs, mouse wheel, ctrl-tab
- Hot-tracking listview
- Full-row select
- test to make sure that filesystemwatcher events still fire even when updating the UI
- copy/move should show progress (write bytes, as opposed to File.Copy()?) 
	- should it use built-in copy/move functionality?
	- ability to queue items to copy/move
- Type to find (like servant salamander)
- preview panel for some filetypes (QuickLook ?)
- Configuration (view, columns, icon size, extensions to grab icons for)
- Specifying columns to show in listview (should be done in the childresource?)
- command line - orthodox specifications
- FTP drive functionality
- SCP drive functionality
- NFS drive functionality
- Compressed file shows files contained within

VISTA BUGS
	- No icon overlays
	- Ugly child-tab buttons (I want them flat)
	- ProgressDisk in wrong position -- needs to be attached to status bar somehow
