BUGS
- Parent/root directory shows detailed information just like a regular directory
- Error messages do not show up on top of the window
- KeyCodes in the settings prevents other settings from loading
- Filesystem events don't correctly update status bar
- Filter textbox too small to fit
- Flickering textboxes when resizing
- network drives don't get filesystemwatcher events
- splitcontainer context menu shows up after an action is selected in a listview context menu
- long-running threads to get directories/files invoked from the drive drop down aren't canceled
	when starting a new operation
- flicker in drive dropdown when new drive is inserted
	- instead of clearing the drive dropdown and adding newly added drives, just insert/remove the drive being changed
- multi-selection doesn't work with drag-and-drop
