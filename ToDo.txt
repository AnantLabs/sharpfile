- Sort output
- ColumnNames abbreviated in XML file
- Set wait interval based if it is a calculated property
- Make calculated properties work better...
- "Time to collect" output should not always happen -- maybe a cmd-line arg
- Tree should be able to use template 
- Tree should be able to use "table" output
- Add comments to all code
- getReplacedOutput is pretty lame -- there must be a better way for that to work
